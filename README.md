## About the Project

**VulnHunt** is an interactive, browser-based cybersecurity training game. Disguised as a retro Linux terminal, it challenges players to spot critical security flaws—like SQL Injections, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Broken Authentication—hidden within real-world code snippets across various languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, etc.).

For every vulnerability verified, players earn XP, build streaks, and receive detailed explanations and secure patch solutions for the analyzed threats. 

## Features

- **Terminal Aesthetic**: Clean, dark-mode UI with mono-spaced typography, subtle glowing effects, and command-line interactions.
- **Multi-Vector Analysis**: Challenges cover the OWASP Top 10 (Injection, Sensitive Data Exposure, Misconfigurations, etc.).
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Questions are randomized, and options are shuffled on every playthrough to ensure replayability.
- **Hint System**: Stuck on a module? Decrypt a hint at the cost of valuable timer seconds.
- **Post-Game Reports**: Get a detailed mastery breakdown of your performance by category, complete with actionable advice for improvement.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [React 18](https://react.dev/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Styling**: Native inline styles (Zero external CSS dependencies!)
